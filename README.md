# EEG
## EEG Proyecto Tesis / Thesis Project 2021

#### EEG measurement and processing based on the OpenBCI Cyton Board (8 channel)

Processing and testing done with JupyterNotebooks.
Done with Python 3.7. Libraries used:

  -Numpy>=1.14.3
  
  -Pandas>=0.22.0
  
  -Scipy>=1.0.0
  
  -Brainflow
  
  -Tensorflow
  
  -Pyserial>=2.7
  
  -Requests>=2.7
  
  -Jupyter 
  
  -Bitstring
  
Since this was done on Jupyter, it is all executed in cascade. I will be separating parts of the code into different .py files. The order is as follows:
  1. record.py
  2. initializedata.py
  3. filtering.py
  4. fourier.py
  5. autoencoder.py
  6. lossvalidation.py
  7. kmeans.py
